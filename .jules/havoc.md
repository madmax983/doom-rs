## 2024-05-18 - [Havoc: OOM on TEXTURE1 parser]
**Learning:** Doom's TEXTURE1 parsing uses a direct 4-byte `num_textures` read to allocate `Vec::with_capacity(num_textures)`. Fuzzing this length with large values triggers an immediate OOM.
**Action:** Use `.min(data.len() / 4)` to clamp lengths derived from WAD/lump headers, preventing massive allocations while still ensuring we parse valid entries up to the slice boundary.

**Havoc: Bounds-checking allocations**
**Learning:** Uncapped allocations driven by input (like network packets or save files) can cause AddressSanitizer/allocator Out-Of-Memory errors and Denial of Service. In Rust,  attempts to allocate the requested size immediately, leading to massive memory usage when the capacity is arbitrary.
**Action:** Use  when reserving memory based on input-controlled sizes. Limit capacities on things like Network rollbacks or save game parsers.

**Safe String Slicing and Split**
**Learning:** You shouldn't blindly use `.find(char)` followed by `&str[pos + 1..]`. It's technically safe if the searched char is exactly 1-byte long (like `\n` or `=`), because then the char boundary immediately follows it, but it's brittle to modifications and relies on subtle ASCII properties.
**Action:** The idiomatic Rust way to parse this is `str::split_once(char)` rather than manually finding the byte offset and slicing. If you must use byte offsets to advance past a character, use `pos + char.len_utf8()` to be explicitly safe.
