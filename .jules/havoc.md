## 2024-05-18 - [Havoc: OOM on TEXTURE1 parser]
**Learning:** Doom's TEXTURE1 parsing uses a direct 4-byte `num_textures` read to allocate `Vec::with_capacity(num_textures)`. Fuzzing this length with large values triggers an immediate OOM.
**Action:** Use `.min(data.len() / 4)` to clamp lengths derived from WAD/lump headers, preventing massive allocations while still ensuring we parse valid entries up to the slice boundary.

**Havoc: Bounds-checking allocations**
**Learning:** Uncapped allocations driven by input (like network packets or save files) can cause AddressSanitizer/allocator Out-Of-Memory errors and Denial of Service. In Rust,  attempts to allocate the requested size immediately, leading to massive memory usage when the capacity is arbitrary.
**Action:** Use  when reserving memory based on input-controlled sizes. Limit capacities on things like Network rollbacks or save game parsers.

**Overflow Panics on Game State Restoration**
**Learning:** Naive addition `*cur + amount` inside functions processing user input (or parsed save game files) can panic due to overflow. Here, `give_ammo` panicked when `amount` was maliciously inflated.
**Action:** Always use `.saturating_add()` or `.checked_add()` when summing values derived from untrusted streams like save games. Proptesting with `u32::MAX` quickly finds these.
