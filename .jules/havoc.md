## 2024-05-18 - [Havoc: OOM on TEXTURE1 parser]
**Learning:** Doom's TEXTURE1 parsing uses a direct 4-byte `num_textures` read to allocate `Vec::with_capacity(num_textures)`. Fuzzing this length with large values triggers an immediate OOM.
**Action:** Use `.min(data.len() / 4)` to clamp lengths derived from WAD/lump headers, preventing massive allocations while still ensuring we parse valid entries up to the slice boundary.

**Havoc: Bounds-checking allocations**
**Learning:** Uncapped allocations driven by input (like network packets or save files) can cause AddressSanitizer/allocator Out-Of-Memory errors and Denial of Service. In Rust,  attempts to allocate the requested size immediately, leading to massive memory usage when the capacity is arbitrary.
**Action:** Use  when reserving memory based on input-controlled sizes. Limit capacities on things like Network rollbacks or save game parsers.

**Fuzzing Integer Overflow in segment_intersection_frac**
**Learning:** Subtracting two `i32` values can overflow if one is `i32::MAX` and the other is `i32::MIN`. Casting the result to `i64` after the subtraction `i64::from(bx - ax)` does not prevent the overflow panic.
**Action:** Always cast the individual `i32` operands to a larger integer type like `i64` *before* performing the subtraction (e.g., `i64::from(bx) - i64::from(ax)`), not after.
