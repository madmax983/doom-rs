## 2024-05-18 - [Havoc: OOM on TEXTURE1 parser]
**Learning:** Doom's TEXTURE1 parsing uses a direct 4-byte `num_textures` read to allocate `Vec::with_capacity(num_textures)`. Fuzzing this length with large values triggers an immediate OOM.
**Action:** Use `.min(data.len() / 4)` to clamp lengths derived from WAD/lump headers, preventing massive allocations while still ensuring we parse valid entries up to the slice boundary.

**Havoc: Bounds-checking allocations**
**Learning:** Uncapped allocations driven by input (like network packets or save files) can cause AddressSanitizer/allocator Out-Of-Memory errors and Denial of Service. In Rust,  attempts to allocate the requested size immediately, leading to massive memory usage when the capacity is arbitrary.
**Action:** Use  when reserving memory based on input-controlled sizes. Limit capacities on things like Network rollbacks or save game parsers.

## Overflow in radius attack

**Learning:** `i32` arithmetic inside game logic (e.g., `damage * distance / radius`) can easily overflow and panic when exposed to extreme inputs (like fuzzing), since it assumes "reasonable" distances.

**Action:** Always cast bounds-checked integer operations in mathematical damage/movement formulas to a larger type (e.g., `i64`) before multiplying, then `.clamp()` back to the expected type to avoid `attempt to multiply with overflow` panics.
