**Goal:** Provide context for testing strategy.
## 2024-03-18 - Unreachable state in GamePhaseController

**Learning:** `GamePhaseController::tick_intermission` assumes it's only called when `self.phase` is `GamePhase::Intermission`. While this is guaranteed by the current call site (`tick()`), if someone were to call `tick_intermission` directly (or change `tick()`) while in another state, it would hit an `unreachable!()` panic.

**Action:** Added a specific `#[should_panic]` test `tick_intermission_unreachable_panic` to guarantee this invariant is protected. Similarly for `MobjSlab::alloc`'s free-list checking logic.
## 2024-03-18 - Missing edge case testing in WAD directory lookups

**Learning:** `WadFile::find_lump_data` and `WadFile::lumps_between` lacked tests verifying their behavior when requested lumps weren't found or for boundary conditions like zero-sized marker lumps (e.g. `F_START`/`F_END`). Similarly, `WadStack` lacked tests for checking if it actually detects a valid `has_iwad` and retrieving ordered lumps.
**Action:** Added targeted test cases `map_lump_group_missing_lumps_returns_none`, `find_lump_data_returns_none_if_missing`, `lumps_between_returns_correct_range` in `WadFile`. For `WadStack`, added `has_iwad_detects_base_wad`, `all_lumps_iterates_in_order`, and `map_lump_group_searches_pwads_first`. For `LumpDef`, added basic checks `lump_def_end` and `lump_def_is_marker`. This improves branch coverage significantly for wad parsing and searching.
## 2024-03-28 - Range Overflow in Random Functions

**Learning:** `GameState::p_random_range` could panic due to range overflow if not using saturating adds for very large bounds. Although `saturating_add` and wide `i64` math prevented integer underflows gracefully, property testing bounds can ensure no regressions occur.
**Action:** Added a `proptest!` fuzzing block to `p_random_range` and `p_subrandom` in `crates/doom-game/src/state.rs` to continuously verify the panic safety of the bounded random functions.
