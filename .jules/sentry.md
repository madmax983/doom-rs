## Sentry's Journal

**Goal:** Provide context for testing strategy.
## 2024-03-18 - Unreachable state in GamePhaseController

**Learning:** `GamePhaseController::tick_intermission` assumes it's only called when `self.phase` is `GamePhase::Intermission`. While this is guaranteed by the current call site (`tick()`), if someone were to call `tick_intermission` directly (or change `tick()`) while in another state, it would hit an `unreachable!()` panic.

**Action:** Added a specific `#[should_panic]` test `tick_intermission_unreachable_panic` to guarantee this invariant is protected. Similarly for `MobjSlab::alloc`'s free-list checking logic.
## 2024-03-18 - Missing edge case testing in WAD directory lookups

**Learning:** `WadFile::find_lump_data` and `WadFile::lumps_between` lacked tests verifying their behavior when requested lumps weren't found or for boundary conditions like zero-sized marker lumps (e.g. `F_START`/`F_END`). Similarly, `WadStack` lacked tests for checking if it actually detects a valid `has_iwad` and retrieving ordered lumps.
**Action:** Added targeted test cases `map_lump_group_missing_lumps_returns_none`, `find_lump_data_returns_none_if_missing`, `lumps_between_returns_correct_range` in `WadFile`. For `WadStack`, added `has_iwad_detects_base_wad`, `all_lumps_iterates_in_order`, and `map_lump_group_searches_pwads_first`. For `LumpDef`, added basic checks `lump_def_end` and `lump_def_is_marker`. This improves branch coverage significantly for wad parsing and searching.
## 2024-03-29 - Missing bounds test in DehPatch::apply

**Learning:** `DehPatch::apply` safely checked bounds for `thing_num` and `frame_num` using `.get_mut()` and returning an `OutOfRange` error. However, there was no test coverage explicitly validating that this error is returned correctly when malformed patches supply an index outside the boundaries of `MOBJINFO` or `STATES`.

**Action:** Added two specific tests `deh_apply_out_of_range_thing` and `deh_apply_out_of_range_frame` that manually create an out-of-bounds patch and confirm that `.apply()` correctly returns an `Err(DehError::OutOfRange)`.
