## 2024-03-18 - Unreachable state in GamePhaseController

**Learning:** `GamePhaseController::tick_intermission` assumes it's only called when `self.phase` is `GamePhase::Intermission`. While this is guaranteed by the current call site (`tick()`), if someone were to call `tick_intermission` directly (or change `tick()`) while in another state, it would hit an `unreachable!()` panic.

**Action:** Added a specific `#[should_panic]` test `tick_intermission_unreachable_panic` to guarantee this invariant is protected. Similarly for `MobjSlab::alloc`'s free-list checking logic.
