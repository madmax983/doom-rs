//! The unseen hand: AI Director and dynamic difficulty.
//!
//! Not everything in Doom is statically placed. The `AiDirector` watches the player's
//! health and performance, subtly deciding when to apply pressure and when to grant relief.
//!
//! This module introduces dynamic spawning decisions. When the player is doing too well,
//! it might unleash an ambush; when they are on the brink of death, it might hold back
//! or provide a breather, ensuring the pacing remains tense but fair.
